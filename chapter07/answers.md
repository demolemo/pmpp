## Exercise 1
If this means calculating y[0] then it's 51.

## Exercise 2
`y = {8, 21, 13, 20, 7}` - not sure about the convolution definition around the boundary points. check it later.

## Exercise 3
1. this does absolutely nothing
2. this shifts signal right
3. this shifts signal left
4. this smooths a signal i think (how is this smoothing different to the next one)
5. this smooths signal too, but taking the current position in the account

## Exercise 4
buah, i don't like this task, no thinking purely compute, will do later
1. this 
2. is
3. crap

## Exercise 5
same as above, will do later, when have inspiration to do some calculations by hand
1. this
2. is
3. crap

## Exercise 6
1. this
2. is
3. crap

## Exercise 7
1. this
2. is
3. crap

## Exercise 8
add third dimension, something at least a little bit interesting

## Exercise 9
add third dimension, something at least a little bit interesting

## Exercise 10
third dimension

This chapter sucks ass, idk why they added it to the book. just to show off i guess
