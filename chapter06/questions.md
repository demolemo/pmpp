# CUDA Exercises - Chapter 6

## Exercise 1
Write a matrix multiplication kernel function that corresponds to the design illustrated in Fig. 6.4.

## Exercise 2
For tiled matrix multiplication, of the possible range of values for BLOCK_SIZE, for what values of BLOCK_SIZE will the kernel completely avoid uncoalesced accesses to global memory? (You need to consider only square blocks.)

## Exercise 3
Consider the following CUDA kernel:

```c
__global__ void foo_kernel(float* a, float* b, float* c, float* d, float* e) {
    unsigned int i = blockIdx.x*blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    __shared__ float a_s[256];
    __shared__ float bc_s[4*256];
    a_s[threadIdx.x] = a[i];
    for(unsigned int j = 0; j < 4; ++j) {
        bc_s[j*256 + threadIdx.x] = b[j*blockDim.x*gridDim.x + i] + c[i*4 + j];
    }
    __syncthreads();
    d[i + 8] = a_s[threadIdx.x];
    e[i*8] = bc_s[threadIdx.x*4];
}
```

For each of the following memory accesses, specify whether they are coalesced or uncoalesced or coalescing is not applicable.

**a.** The access to array `a` of line 05

**b.** The access to array `a_s` of line 05

**c.** The access to array `b` of line 07

**d.** The access to array `c` of line 07

**e.** The access to array `bc_s` of line 07

**f.** The access to array `a_s` of line 10

**g.** The access to array `d` of line 10

**h.** The access to array `bc_s` of line 11

**i.** The access to array `e` of line 11

## Exercise 4
What is the floating point to global memory access ratio (in OP/B) of each of the following matrix-matrix multiplication kernels?

**a.** The simple kernel described in Chapter 3, Multidimensional Grids and Data, without any optimizations applied.

**b.** The kernel described in Chapter 5, Memory Architecture and Data Locality, with shared memory tiling applied using a tile size of 32 × 32.

**c.** The kernel described in this chapter with shared memory tiling applied using a tile size of 32 × 32 and thread coarsening applied using a coarsening factor of 4.
